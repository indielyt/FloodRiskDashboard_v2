A structure-based risk assessment was performed to differentiate the exposure to flood hazards among residential structures in the FEMA mapped floodplains. Three pillars of risk exposure were conceptualized. "Flood Risk" (FR_TOT) evaluates exposure to mapped flood zone types. "100-year Exceedence Probability" (EP_TOT) evaluates probability of structure inundation at the 100-year flood as derived from the probabilistic floodplain. "Flood Damage Potential" (FDP_TOT) evaluates risk by the exposure to water depth and velocity during the 100-year flood.  The three pillars were weighted (20%, 40%, 40% respectively) and summed to derive a structure-based "Total Risk Score" (R_SCORE). A user defined weighting interface is provided to adjust the default weights to derive a "User Defined Weighting Score."
