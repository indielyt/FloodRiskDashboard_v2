A flood risk assessment was performed at the structure level by quantifying flood risk using multiple user-defined weight-based risk criteria within individual weight-based risk categories. Total Risk Score (R_Score) defines a structures overall total flood risk combining the following categories of exposure. Flood Risk Score (FR_TOT) evaluates a structures exposure to mapped flood hazards. 100-year Exceedance Probability (EP_TOT) evaluates the probability of structure inundation during a 100-year flood event (derived from the probabilistic Monte Carlo simulations). Flood Damage Potential (FDP_TOT) defines a structures loss or damage potential using Average Annualized Percent Loss (AAPL) calculations that can be applied to building values.
